My first project - InfoCovid
This was the first project in which I participated.
It was a team project that we had to develop in 3 weeks as the final project for the course unit "Laborat√≥rio e Projeto 1".

The goal of this project was that we developed a Application in Java that met all the requirements asked in the Specifications and Requirements Document (EnunciadoLAPR1_Covid19Analysis.pdf that can be found in...).

This project was finished successfully.
